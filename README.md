# kotor2-mod-prologue-benefits

A mod for "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords" 
which fixes the inventory and XP loss during the first section of the game.

In details, this mod does the following:
- Save the XP earn by T3-M4 during the prologue
  - The XP is first re-assigned during the Hangar/Fuel section with T3-M4 and saved back when switch to the Exile
  - The total earned XP with T3-M4 is given back when T3 joins the party
- Properly separating the inventory of T3-M4 (including the Prologue acquisitions) and the Exile.
- Both inventories are merged when T3-M4 joins the party
