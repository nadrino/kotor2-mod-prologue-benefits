# kotor2-mod-prologue-benefits

A mod for "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords" 
which fixes the inventory and XP loss during the first section of the game.

In the original and TSLRCM version of the game, none of the benefits from
the Prologue are kept for the rest of the game which makes not much sense
in the story. This mod fixes this anomaly.

In details, this mod does the following:
- Save the XP earn by T3-M4 during the prologue
  - The XP is temporarly re-assigned during the Hangar/Fuel section with T3-M4
  - The total earned XP with T3-M4 is given back when T3 joins the party
- Properly separating the inventory of T3-M4 (including the Prologue acquisitions) and the Exile.
- Both inventories are merged when T3-M4 joins the party
